Setup                                                             *sketch.setup*

M.setup({options})                                                     *M.setup*

    Parameters: ~
        {options}  (table)  configuration options:
                             * {executables} (table) optional
                               Configuration for executable commands for specific
                               languages. Each key represents a supported language,
                               and the corresponding value can be a string specifying
                               a single executable command or a table of executable
                               commands for that language.
                               Example:
                               ```
                               executables = {
                                 typescript = { "bun run", "deno", "ts-node" },
                                 rust = "rustc",
                                 lua = "lua",
                                 python = "python"
                               }
                               ```

                             * {strategy} (string) optional
                               Specifies the execution environment for the commands.
                               Currently, only 'term' is supported as an environment.

                             * {custom_strategy} (function) optional
                               A custom strategy function for executing commands. You
                               can define your own execution strategy and pass it here.
                               The function should take the command string as its
                               argument.
                               Example:
                               ```lua
                               custom_strategy = function(command)
                                 -- Your custom logic here
                                 print("Executing custom command:", command)
                               end
                               ```

                             * {preferred_languages} (table) optional
                               A table of preferred languages in the order you want
                               them to appear when choosing the language for code execution.
                               If not specified, all supported languages will be available.
                               Example:
                               ```
                               preferred_languages = { "typescript", "rust" }
                               ```
