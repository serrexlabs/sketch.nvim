---@mod sketch.setup Setup
---@param options table configuration options:
--- * {executables} (table) optional
---   Configuration for executable commands for specific
---   languages. Each key represents a supported language,
---   and the corresponding value can be a string specifying
---   a single executable command or a table of executable
---   commands for that language.
---   Example:
---   ```
---   executables = {
---     typescript = { "bun run", "deno", "ts-node" },
---     rust = "rustc",
---     lua = "lua",
---     python = "python"
---   }
---   ```
---
--- * {strategy} (string) optional
---   Specifies the execution environment for the commands.
---   Currently, only 'term' is supported as an environment.
---
--- * {custom_strategy} (function) optional
---   A custom strategy function for executing commands. You
---   can define your own execution strategy and pass it here.
---   The function should take the command string as its
---   argument.
---   Example:
---   ```lua
---   custom_strategy = function(command)
---     -- Your custom logic here
---     print("Executing custom command:", command)
---   end
---   ```
---
--- * {preferred_languages} (table) optional
---   A table of preferred languages in the order you want
---   them to appear when choosing the language for code execution.
---   If not specified, all supported languages will be available.
---   Example:
---   ```
---   preferred_languages = { "typescript", "rust" }
---   ```
